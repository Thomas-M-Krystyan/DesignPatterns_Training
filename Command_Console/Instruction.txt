		Display the changed text to reflect the following scenarios:

1. Font color was changed (user input 1, 2, 3... => using proper command => passing user input as argument to the command)

2. Font weight was changed (this is also possible in console!)

3. Text background was changed (do not forget that the font color and font background are two different things)

4. Don't forget to prevent choosing invalid options by user
