The purpose of this exercise is to train implementation of Builder design pattern and to compare it with Abstract Factory one.

1. There are given unit tests checking whether the code was properly implemented. Follow unit tests (like in TDD approach) as guidelines to implement the missing Builder and Factory logic.

2. Implementations from:
- ConcreteFactory,
- FactoryManager,
- PizzaBuilder,
- BuilderDirector

were corrupted (cleaned up entirely or partially => replaced by throw new NotImplementedException placeholders)

Your task is to reimplement the code using your knowledge about Builder and Factory patterns, and following unit tests checking expected data.

3. Pay attention and try to spot the difference between both design patterns. They purpose is very similar => to create new objects, however, the approaches to achieve this result are different.
