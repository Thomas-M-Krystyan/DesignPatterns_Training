1. Check class "Program.cs":

- It has 2 foreach loops iterating over graph traverse strategies. However, these objects are classes
  and does not support iteration, as well as Graph data structure itself.


2. Check interface "IStrategy.cs"

- Fix the NOTE comment, which was left by the previous author.


3. In the folder "Iterator"

- Implement BfsIterator and DfsIterator using respective traverse strategies.
- Iterator should allow to iterate over BFS_Strategy and DFS_Strategy
- Iterator should return currently visited (iterated) Node
- Iterator should be able to answer the question, how many Nodes are there in total
- Finally, Iterator should be safe enough to not throw any exceptions while it be
  used in foreach loops


4. Make to code compilable and all unit tests passing.

Have fun!
