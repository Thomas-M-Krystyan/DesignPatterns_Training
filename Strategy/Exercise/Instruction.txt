                            "Strategy" exercise:

Please, finish the implementation of Strategy design pattern. This exercise
requires additionaly a knowledge about graph traverse algorithms such as
Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). Feel free to check
their implementation in the Internet.

                                Requirements:

1. Implement Context class
2. Introduce required strategy interface
3. Implement BFS algorithm in a specific strategy
4. Implement DFS algorithm in a specific strategy
5. Use Context and both strategies in Program.cs


                              Expected outcome:

- Code is compiling
- Strategy design pattern was introduced
- All unit tests must pass (you cannot change them)
- Program.cs workflow is finished and working
