                    1. Inside of the paragraph <p> given below we want to apply a HTML inline style (to not play with CSS and Bootstrap).
                        This style would be responsible to format how our text is displayed on the webpage.
                    2. We would like to use property in a ViewModel to handle different styles and to avoid hardcoding them in CSHTML document
                    3. Unfortunately, we cannot just copy and paste some .NET string there - e.g., "style=color: red". This text needs to be decoded as HTML
                    3. The most obvious solution would be to use the following helper method: Html.Raw("some text to be converted into working HTML code")
                    4. However, such approach is considered to be unsafe => prone to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks on your webpage

                    NOTE: Read these articles to learn why you should not use Html.Raw("") helper method but safer alternatives
