1. Add missing "text weight"" functionality:
   - A new button for font weight in Index.cshtml
   - Name the button "B" (like "bold")
   - Create a proper REST API method in MVC controller (use example) for font weight
   - Connect this new method (from MVC controller) to your button (in the view)
   - Use DTO model (the already implemented one or a new one - as you wish)
     for an example true/false to check if text should be set to bold or not

2. Add missing "text background" functionality:
   - A new button for text background in Index.cshtml
   - Name the button "Background"
   - Create a proper REST API method in MVC controller (use example) for text background
   - Connect this new method (from MVC controller) to your button (in the view)
   - Use DTO model (the already implemented one or a new one - as you wish)
     to pass information which background color should be used (use an example from "font color" functionality)
   - Create a new drop-down control (in HTML) to show all possible background color options
     (use an example for "font color" how to send a selected option from view, as an Enum, back to MVC controller)

3. Consider cleaning up the view (nice button styles, alignment, user experience => to make it easy to use)
